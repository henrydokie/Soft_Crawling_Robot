📆 Overview: What Happens Each Month?

---

📍 Detailed 3-Month Plan

📅 Month 1: Design & Fabrication (Weeks 1-4)

🏗️ Build Goals:
✅ Sketch motion strategy (worm, caterpillar, inching, etc.)
✅ CAD design for air chambers, body, and mold
✅ Create soft lithography molds (3D printing or photomask)
✅ Cast and cure PDMS/Ecoflex

📢 Content Plan:
✅ Week 1 – Project Announcement Post

Post: "I'm building a soft robot that crawls using air! Follow along."

Format: Photo/Short Video of sketches & concept.


✅ Week 2 – Design & CAD Modeling

Post: "Here’s how I designed my soft robot's air chambers."

Format: Carousel (Instagram/Twitter) or CAD Timelapse (Reels/TikTok)


✅ Week 3 – Soft Lithography Process

Post: "Making molds for my soft robot using soft lithography."

Format: Step-by-step tutorial video


✅ Week 4 – First PDMS Cast

Post: "Peeling the robot out of the mold. Satisfying or cursed?"

Format: Slow-mo demolding video + reaction poll



---

📅 Month 2: Assembly & Actuation (Weeks 5-8)

🏗️ Build Goals:
✅ Bond PDMS layers and attach air channels
✅ Test manual inflation using syringes or pumps
✅ Adjust design based on first movement tests
✅ Integrate an Arduino + solenoid valves (if automating)

📢 Content Plan:
✅ Week 5 – Bonding & Assembly

Post: "Sealing the air chambers—making sure no leaks!"

Format: Close-up video of bonding process


✅ Week 6 – First Inflation Test (Manual)

Post: "Does it move? First test inflating the soft robot!"

Format: Reaction video showing movement success/failure


✅ Week 7 – Troubleshooting & Adjustments

Post: "Tuning the air pressure & movement—soft robots are tricky!"

Format: Side-by-side video (before vs. after fixes)


✅ Week 8 – Automated Actuation (if applicable)

Post: "Making it move on its own with solenoid valves & Arduino!"

Format: Reel/TikTok showing code & automated movement



--------------------



📅 Month 3: Optimization & Final Reveal (Weeks 9-12)

🏗️ Build Goals:
✅ Optimize movement efficiency (speed, grip, sequence)
✅ Test different surfaces (carpet, wood, rough terrain)
✅ Record final demo video
✅ Wrap-up and reflection

📢 Content Plan:
✅ Week 9 – Performance Upgrades

Post: "Does it crawl faster? Testing different air pressures."

Format: Timelapse comparison (slow vs. fast)


✅ Week 10 – Fun Testing (Surface Challenge)

Post: "Will my soft robot survive different surfaces?"

Format: Obstacle course challenge video


✅ Week 11 – Final Reveal

Post: "Here it is! Fully functional soft robot crawling!"

Format: Cinematic final demo video


✅ Week 12 – Lessons & Next Steps

Post: "What I learned building my first soft robot—what’s next?"

Format: Talking head video or text post reflecting on the process
